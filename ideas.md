### Alignment strategies
#### Manual calibration
Add handling for arrow keys and the + and - keys to let the user zoom in or out and shift the position of the image to better align with reality.
Possibly add other recognizable objects to use as calibration targets, and/or enable locking one point in place and shifting the remainder of the image with respect to it.

### Automatic calibration
Use a QR Code or other similar machine-recognizable pattern projected on one corner of the image, to shift the image's on-screen representation to match that seen from projector.
