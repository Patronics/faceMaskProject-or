# faceMaskProject-or
A project to project masks onto faces of innocent bystanders

Uses OpenCV and Python 3.11 to track the position of people's faces, and, in conjunction with a projector, draw shapes onto their faces.

Use the number keys 1-4 to set the display mode. Actual mask image and automatic alignment functionality still a WIP.
